## Configuration

Algolia Search provider are configurable by these configuration keys:

* **Search.Provider** is the name of the search provider and must be **AlgoliaSearch**.
* **Search.AlgoliaSearch.ApiId** is a Application ID for algolia server.
* **Search.AlgoliaSearch.ApiKey** is a Write API Key for either algolia server.

```
"AlgoliaSearch": {
    "AppId": "API_ID",
    "ApiKey": "API_KEY"
}
```

## Sorting results

Algolia uses one ranking strategy per index. If you want to use different rankings for the same data, you can use replica indices.

To configure available replicas, go to Settings > Algolia search > Sorting.

To help you identify your replica indices, adopt a naming pattern such as {documentType}:{sortingAttribute}-{asc or desc}.

For example, product:price-desc is a replica index of your products index, where the results are sorted by the price attribute in descending order.

If replica indices are not configured, the default index is used and a warning message is added to the log.
